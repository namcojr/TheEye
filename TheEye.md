TheEye is a new project to replicate IVAO's aircraft and ATC web application that will display all traffic online from both pilots and ATC (Air traffic controllers). Example payloads are below.

The application should run natively in windows and linux, we are currently building the windows version here and after it is working and feature-locked, we will clone the project on a linux machine to proceed with its native version implementation.

The application should be resizable, present a map described below, have some selectable themes (dark, light, blue, green, orange, etc) and map the ATC regions as well as the pilot planes flying based on supplied coordinates data from the API.

I am going to define a few basic landmarks but these are to be expanded by you in order to have an organized TODO.md file where we will have such landmarks, questions from you to me and vice-versa while keeping such file very clean and direct. This own TheEye.md can be used as logging or project memory as you see fit.

The map should use what we already implemented in an application 'SAS Acars' in this same computer, a parent repository inside /repos.

LANDMARKS / REQUISITES
======================

- Fastest code possible, either C++ or C# taking into account it needs to later run on Linux.
- Best presentation possible for Windows and Linux, using their native UI elements
- Look into the "Examples" folder. ivae_main.png shows the layout (tabbed) that should be implemented. Tabs
MAIN MAP CONTROLLERS PILOTS and STATISTICS should be implemented, the rest is not required. ivae_map shows
the old map view, where every ATC position or pilot icon (not displayed here) is clickable, then a window
will open with details regarding the position, either ATC or pilot.
- Icons for the aircraft (all 360 positions for 360 angles) can be found on the same SAS Acars project in the parent folders inside resources inair (IVAO traffic) and inair2 (own aircraft) folders. After the project skeleton is working, i will provide more icons for different types of aircraft.
- I can also try to find the executable for the old ivae we are rebuilding here in case you need to fetch anything from it. I am not sure but IIRC this is a VBasic.NET x86 application

- Check api.ivao.aero/docs and analyze the possibility of in-app login to process data without having an API
key.

LANDMARKS
=========

1. - Build the native application with a movable map by using the mouse (click-and-drag), fetch data from the server and display ATC polygons alongside pilot icons. Check then "modern map" image for an example.
2. - Clickable items. When clicking on an ATC window or aircraft icon, open a dialog containing detailed data for the station or aircraft: Callsign, route, aircraft icon (i will provide a source later). If an aircraft is selected, its route should be traced on map, based on API provided data.
3. - Add and maintain "friends" by its ID, i am not sure this will require user to login and i am not sure
how to handle this yet, probably through IVAO's login API.

This is all for now, please build your own landmarks as you see fit for buildable/testable by me builds.



DATA FETCHING EXAMPLES
======================

Example pilot payload can be fetched from
https://api.ivao.aero/v2/tracker/now/pilots/summary

Example ATC payload can be fetched from
https://api.ivao.aero/v2/tracker/now/atc/summary

The statistics for totals online, etc from
https://api.ivao.aero/v2/tracker/now/connections/stats

This is an example request, we have to pass some headers for it to work as
the public API.

```public static async Task<string> DownloadIvaoData(IvaoDatatypeEnum type)
{
    string url = type == IvaoDatatypeEnum.Pilot ? IVAO_PILOT_DATA : IVAO_ATC_DATA;
    try
    {
        AcarsConfiguration.WebAccessHandler.Invoke(null, true);

        HttpClientHandler handler = new()
        {
            CookieContainer = AcarsConfiguration.CookieJar,
            UseCookies = true
        };
        string path = url.Replace("https://api.ivao.aero", "");
        HttpClient client = new(handler, true);

        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("ApiKey", "GET_YOUR_OWN_KEY");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Origin", "https://webeye.ivao.aero");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("authority", "api.ivao.aero");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("method", "GET");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("path", path);

        string response = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
        AcarsConfiguration.WebAccessHandler(null, false);

        return response;
    }
    catch
    {
        AcarsConfiguration.WebAccessHandler.Invoke(null, false);
        return null;
    }
}```

THINGS TO ADD / CORRECTIONS
===========================

- Regarding authentication, please check Examples/A330 Speed.PNG in order to know what i'd like to see on the pilot's card. Flags and logos are a long long shot (can this be done?) but the time online, software, simulator in use, speed, altitude, callsign, DEP and ARR airports as well as pilotID and HOME, etc would be interesting. api.ivao.aero/v2/tracker/sessions/<sessionid> shows all required data for this. This is why i mentioned authentication as i THINK this endpoint requires it in order to return data.

- When we click on an aircraft, make the route pass through the aircraft as well (so, departure point, aircraft, arrival point). In webeye, the route is actually traced from the pilot's aircraft data provided when we click on it: api.ivao.aero/v2/tracker/sessions/<sessionid>/tracks.

- Make the aircraft + route centred on screen when we click on one.
